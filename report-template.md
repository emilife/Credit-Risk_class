## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
Purpose of analysis is to predict risk on the following dataset.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
The fincial data was on 
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any other algorithms).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. 
Obhective is to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. Youâ€™ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?

Answer:0 is represented better. It preforms better becouse the precsion is 1.00.

* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

Answer: It is able predict poeple that arent at risk is 0 and people at risk is 1.

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
Answer: Recomended company use logistic regression model for the reason listed above.
